# JavaChatServer
Java chat server from "scratch" utilizing websockets with Java NIO Channels, Non-blocking IO, and Selectors. Packets are read bitwise and encrypted using SHA1. 
Also have a functional andriod app that cannnect with the browser client.
I also made the same server in node.js and spring framework as a proof of concept and later utilized docker and gradle.
